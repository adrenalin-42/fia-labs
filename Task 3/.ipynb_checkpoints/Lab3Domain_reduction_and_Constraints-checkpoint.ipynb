    "Explanation\n",
    "-   **`backtracking_search(csp)`**: A simple \"starter\" function that initializes an empty assignment and calls the main recursive `backtrack` function.\n",
    "-   **`select_unassigned_variable(...)`**: This helper function implements a crucial heuristic called **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)**. Instead of picking the next gate randomly, it intelligently selects the _most constrained_ variable—the one with the fewest available time slots left in its domain. This strategy helps to identify dead-ends much faster, significantly pruning the search tree.\n",
    "-   **`backtrack(assignment, csp)`**: The core recursive function. For a given partial assignment, it performs these steps:\n",
    "    1.  **Base Case:** If the assignment is complete (all gates have a time slot), a solution has been found, and it is returned.\n",
    "    2.  **Variable Selection:** It calls `select_unassigned_variable` to pick the next gate to assign.\n",
    "    3.  **Value Iteration:** It loops through each possible `value` (time slot) in the chosen variable's domain.\n",
    "    4.  **Forward Checking:** If the value is consistent, it’s tentatively assigned. Then, this value is _temporarily removed_ from the domains of all neighboring (linked) gates. This propagation of constraints is a key optimization.\n",
    "    5.  **Recursion:** It calls itself (`backtrack`) to solve the rest of the problem with the newly reduced domains.\n",
    "    6.  **Backtracking:** If the recursive call fails to find a solution (returns `None`), it means the tentative assignment was a dead end. The function then **undoes** the assignment and restores the domains of the neighbors to their previous state, trying the next value in the loop."
