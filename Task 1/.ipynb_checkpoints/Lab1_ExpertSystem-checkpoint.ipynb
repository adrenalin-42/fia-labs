    "To develop the expert system, I began by defining the knowledge base as a hierarchical goal tree. The system is designed to reach one of six primary conclusions: `Earth Business Executive`, `Earth Adventure Tourist`, `Earth Academic`, `Mars Colonist`, `Belt Miner`, and `Loonie`.\n",

The `Earth Origin` branch includes the professional, tourist, and academic profiles, while the `Space Origin` branch further distinguishes between Mars Colonists and Belt Miners. The system uses intermediate concepts like `Professional`, `Tourist Behavior`, and `Academic` to connect initial observations to these final conclusions."

    "# Conclusions:\n",
    "In this lab, I studied the basics of expert systems in artificial intelligence, focusing on forward and backward chaining algorithms. I applied these concepts by building an interactive expert system. The development process was iterative, although a recursive approach could have been employed instead. I believe that recursion might offer greater efficiency by reducing redundant checks. Furthermore, my current implementation does not use backward chaining for interactive questioning, but integrating it could provide an additional optimization opportunity."
